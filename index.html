      <h1>Sass For Web Designers</h1>
      <p>
        I’m dusting off this ol’ website to announce that, today, my fifth book
        has been published. It’s called Sass For Web Designers and has a
        familiar pink cover. The book is the 10th release from the wonderful
        folks at A Book Apart. They are the best team an author could hope to
        work with, and I was honored to follow up CSS3 For Web Designers with a
        book about Sass (something I was reluctant to embrace for years). And
        that’s why I wanted to write this book: To convince other folks like me
        out there that Sass can make their lives easier and more efficient when
        it comes to creating websites.

        I thank Dribbble Co-Founder, Rich Thornett, for being relentless in
        advocating Sass’ benefits while I resisted for probably about a year.
        Once I discovered that I didn’t need to learn complex programming or
        command line shenanigans, and that it didn’t need to immediately change
        my workflow or interrupt the way I’ve been writing CSS for a decade,
        well then I was hooked. Using Sass doesn’t mean having to learn Sass in
        its entirety. You can start small, and slowly add more of Sass’
        capabilities over time—even on large, complex, legacy stylesheets. It’s
        what I’ve been doing with Dribbble’s CSS for a long time now. Converting
        more and more of the stylesheet to Sass as needed, or as I have time to
        refactor things and/or learn more about what Sass can help with. You can
        start quickly and easily, then incrementally add more Sass power as you
        become more comfortable with it.
      </p>

        Again, my primary goal for this little pink book is to simply get more
        people interested in using Sass to make their lives easier. Sass is a
        wonderfully helpful tool with a great community behind it, in a
        discipline that can be complicated and frustrating. I’m hoping you give
        Sass, and the book, a try!
      </p>

        And now for a heaping pile of thank yous. To Jeffrey Zeldman, Jason
        Santa Maria, and Mandy Brown for creating a place that I genuinely want
        to write for. To Katel LeDu for being a fantastic project manager and
        steering things the entire way. This year has been particular rough for
        me personally, so it’s especially satisfying to see this thing actually
        released. To Erin Kissane for making me sound far better than I actually
        am. Thanks also to Jina Bolton for tech editing the book, as well as her
        work for the Sass community in general. To Chris Coyier for being
        smarter than all of us and agreeing to write a foreword. Also to Hampton
        Caitlin, Jenn Lukas, and Chris Eppstein for saying nice things about the
        book and letting us print those nice things on the inside cover (which
        Jason brilliantly selected to be Dribbble pink, naturally) among the
        other awesome things they do for the web. Like, I don’t know, creating
        Sass, building Sass, and generally being rad.
